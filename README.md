# Fingerprint-compression-using-fourier-transform
This repository stores a demo file for the innovative project of Mathematics-1 (subject code MA-101). The file "logo.py" contains a list of x and y coordinates of a continuous figure which is used by the driver file "main.py". The file "main.py" uses the following libraries (which are also the requirement for the file to run) : math, pygame and os. The file uses an array of of points and applies the algorithm to it and visually shows the working of the algorithm. It first compresses the given array of points using the fourier transform and then decompresses using the inverse fourier transform to show the difference between the original and the decompressed file by superimposing the two.
